# Rock-Paper_scissor-Game

The game is played with three possible String signals that represent a rock, paper, and scissors. ... Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper. If both players throw the same String signal, it is considered a tie and play resumes until there is a clear winner.
